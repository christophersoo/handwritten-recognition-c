# HANDWRITTEN DIGIT RECOGNITION WITH C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

# DESCRIPTION
This Project uses the C Programming Language to recognise handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.
With the help of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, this project can calculate the euclidean distances between
each images represented by matrices to predict the label of the image. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset.

# HANDWRITTEN DIGIT RECOGNITION USING THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

## DESCRIPTION
This project uses the C Programming language to recognise handwritten digits provided
by the MNIST database. This project mainly uses the K-Nearest-neighbors algorithm
to calculate the euclidean distances between each images represented as matrices. Then
sorting and finding the minimum index to compare and recognise the labels.

## INSTALLATION
To install this project and source code, you can simply navigate to the jj22293.c file and download it.
You can execute the file using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as CLion, VSCode, etc.
Don't forget to import the images datasets such as the Y.matrix file, X.matrix file and the T.matrix file.
